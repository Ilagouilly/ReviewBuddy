# ReviewBuddy (Bonita Community Edition: 2021.1)


## What's ReviewBuddy?

ReviewBuddy is an App that automates Review Processes. From the time an HR representative notifies employees to draft reviews, to the final validation of these Reviews by HR and providing a PDF summary of each.

## What are the sub-processes of ReviewBuddy?

* ReviewHR Pool:

   1) This sub-process allows HR representatives to notify employees that a Review Submission period has started and that they can start drafting their Reviews as well as schedule a Review meeting with their managers.

* Review Pool:

   1) This sub-process starts after the HR representative sends a review notification. 

   2) Employees and managers find a Review Draft task assigned to them in the portal. 

   3) Once both submit a Review Draft and schedule a meeting, they can access and view the information submitted and discuss it. 

   4) Finally, HR representatives can check the information shared and validate (or ask for a review revision) the Review, generating a review summary in PDF format that'll be shared with the involved parties.
